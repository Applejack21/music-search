# music-search application using plain JavaScript

**If you're using this application on a desktop web browser, make sure you've changed to "Responsive Design Mode" (Firefox) or "Toggle Device Toolbar" (Chrome) to simulate its design on a mobile device.**

This uses AJAX to load data from a .JSON file and display them via a search, on click event or on a map.\
In musicStoreMap.js you'll see:
```
gestureHandling: true
```
Only disable this if you're viewing the application on a desktop computer rather than on a phone.\
**However**, I don't know if you'll actually need to disable this, as it seems to let you pan without this commented out 
during development, although intermittently (probably due to cache or something).
