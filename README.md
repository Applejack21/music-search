# music-search application for assignment 2
Assignment 2 application files, using AJAX to load data and display them via a search, on click event or on a map.\
In musicStoreMap.js you'll see:
```
gestureHandling: true
```
Only disable this if you're viewing the application on a desktop computer rather than on a phone.\
**However**, I don't know if you'll actually need to disable this, as it seems to let you pan without this commented out 
during development, although intermittently (probably due to cache or something).
